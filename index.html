                        <strong><a href='https://atomic.io'>Atomic.io</a></strong> was a design tooling startup when I first arrived there. We worked on a very complex React front-end with a 
                        relatively simple Node.js backend. In my time on that project I worked on all aspects of the front and back end. I rearchitected chunks of the state
                        management so that we could build more advanced features. I also worked on a backend implementation that allowed us to import designs from the Figma
                        software tool.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        After some time we pivoted away from the old product to build a more business focussed enterprise tool based on knowledge we garnered from building designer tools. This involved
                        the building out of several green-fields projects. Another developer and I lead the team towards microservices. The team had strong knowledge in Node.js so we built
                        out our backends with koa and Node.js and our infrastructure was mainly Docker based. I also built out our security approach for passwordless authentication.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        After we built out the backend services, I took a lead on our SDK efforts, we needed to build developer tooling for Android, iOS and the web. We had a 2 person team
                        and during that time I built out our native Android SDK and a Preact based web SDK.

                        in implementing accessibility, responsive behaviour and good code architecture for their Patient Portal system
                        which connected patients with their clinical information. The original application was built with legacy technologies
                        so during my time there I pushed for an update in the technology stack that would allow us to keep up
                        with modern browsers including, building proof of concepts for moving from the YUI module system to es6 modules.

                        I built some single page application games in Moodle utilising Knockout.js. I also designed the DB schema and built front-end
